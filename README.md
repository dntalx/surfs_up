## Overview
This analysis was made to see the temperature trends in June and December in order to see if an ice cream shop will do well year-round.

## Results
When we take a look at the temeprature information for the monts of June and December on the tables (accordingly) and graphs below, we can see some important information needed to see if the temperature will be good for an ice cream shop.

1) We can see that the average temperature for June is 75 degrees if we round it up and 71 de grees for December. Looking at both averages, we can see that it is not too cold during the month of December for people to want an ice cream

2) The minimum temperature for the month of June was 64 degrees, while in December, the minimum tempearature was 56. We can look in the graphs how often those tempratures occured during both months and we can see that, while they are not common at all, temperatures during the month of December might not be as favorable for an ice cream business.

3) The maximum temperatures for June and December were 85 and 83 degrees, accordinly.

## Summary
While it is clear that temepratures during the month of December are lower than the temperatures in June, it is not by much, even when we look at how frequent temperatures are during those months. 

In order to have a better understanding about the weather during those months and to see if an ice cream business would do well year-round, I would suggest looiking more into the weather patterns of each month. We can look at the precipitation data and see how much each weather station reports to figure out where the best spot for the shop would be.
